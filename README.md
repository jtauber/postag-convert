# postag-convert

Python library for converting between various morphosyntactic tagging schemes (initially just for Ancient Greek)

No code yet, just:

* initial documentation of schemes: `postag-schemes.md`
* links to or extracts from previous code I've written: `prior-art.md`

Support also planned:

* [Leipzig Glossing Rules](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php) (although problematic for languages like Greek that don't really have morphemes)
* [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) and [universal features](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html) and [universal parts of speech](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html) in particular

but the first priority is just consolidating my existing code.
